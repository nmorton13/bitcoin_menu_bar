## Data Source

- Most Bitcoin data is fetched from the public [mempool.space API](https://mempool.space/docs/api) over HTTPS.
- BTC price and 24h change are fetched from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).
- No API keys or personal data are used—just anonymous requests for the latest blocks, mempool stats, price, fees, and difficulty info.

## Privacy

- The app makes anonymous HTTPS calls to mempool.space for network stats and never sends any personal data.
- No accounts, tracking, or analytics. Settings (refresh interval, icon style, launch-at-login) are stored locally in `UserDefaults`.
- If you’re on a hostile network and want extra protection, consider using a trusted DNS/VPN. Certificate pinning is not enabled.
